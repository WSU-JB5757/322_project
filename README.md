# 322_project

Going to put KanBan and Backlog here. Maybe will add copies of code.

to run the project: Flask, python, a web browser and sqlite must be installed.

run the python file app.py

open the browser to http://localhost:5000/ to get the login page

the site is NOT secure

use the registration button to enter a new user. then return to the login page and use the new user to log in

most features are availabel from the index page. the zoom links do not function. the data used is test data. 

search and blog may not be fully operational. they work, then they disappear. i did not find out why.

user profile, help and privacy policy are under options.

the project will be zipped and should retain the original file structure needed.

several of the python files were used to set-up databases and test values and are not in active use
