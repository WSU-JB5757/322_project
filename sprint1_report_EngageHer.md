# Sprint x Report 
Video Link: https://youtu.be/e8fsJavDhi4?feature=shared
## What's New (User Facing)
 * Feature homepage

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Designed the layouts for the site front-end. Made the homepage, but likely won't finish it to testing standards.

## Unfinished Work
So there are multiple sprints in the same file. I made sprint 1 independent of the main list. I started too late to finish sprint 1.
Simply put, I'm stuck on a project in another class that I can't afford to fail and can't seem to make decent progress on.
