# Sprint x Report 
Video Link: 
## What's New (User Facing)
 * Feature F1: Homepage
 * Feature F2-F5: Other Major Pages of Site
 * Feature F6: User Profile with Database

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
I completed the major pages for the front end of the site. I did not complete the User Profile page becasue I never got to making the database.

## Unfinished Work
I never completed the User Profile because I ran out of time. I had some personal problems, which you're undoubtably sick of hearing about. At least some of those problems should get a bit better now. If it actually gets worse, action must be taken.
